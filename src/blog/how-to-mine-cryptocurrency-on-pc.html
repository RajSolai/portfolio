        Cryptocurrency or Decentralized Money is where the money circulation and
        transaction is being decentralized and managed by a chain of
        computational devices known as blockchain. Cryptocurrency or
        Decentralized Money is where the money circulation and transaction is
        being decentralized and managed by a chain of computational devices
        known as blockchain. A pseudonymous person named Satoshi Nakamoto
        founded a cryptocurrency under the name of <strong>Bitcoin</strong> in
        the year of 2009.

      <p>
        As we discussed early that cryptocurrency is managed by a billion of
        decentralized computer system chained together named as blockchain. In
        short, mining is contributing our computational resource to the
        blockchain by joining the blockchain, Mining crypto is relatively
        simpler than mining diamonds out of caves.

        <em>Mining is not making money out of thin air</em>, yea it does sort of
        but at some expenses, To join a blockchain you would be processing
        transactions made by users and create an entry in ledger,
        <a
          href="https://www.investopedia.com/tech/what-cryptocurrency-public-ledger/"
          >ledger</a
        >
        is long spreadsheet consisting of every transaction details and a
        <a href="https://www.educative.io/edpresso/what-is-hashing"
          >hash code</a
        >
        representing the transaction, so there beings the competition where
        thousands of people given a transaction to process with and create a
        hash value for it and every peer or people sends the hash value
        calculated, the first person or peer to calculate lesser hash value
        would be selected as successful peer to join the blockchain hence the
        peer would be rewarded with some cryptocurrency, Whoa! Congrats, you
        just mined some coins.

        Now we got some information on how mining works, now let’s get into the
        main part <strong>Mining Crypto</strong> but without our personal
        computer. As we know the mining process requires calculation of hash
        values of a random number associated with the transaction and the hash
        value should be lesser in value otherwise it is rejected, so we need a
        computer that can computer several hashes per second this rate is called
        <em>hash rates</em>, each crypto sets different difficult values and
        algorithms for hashing hence the hash rates changes for different CPU,
        GPU and Cryptocurrencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can find your Processor / Graphics Unit’s hash rates
        <a href="https://www.hashrates.com/">here</a>. Unfortunately the bigger
        coins such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum cannot be mined with basic CPU
        or GPU they need some application specific utilities such as ASIC. It’s
        okay, we have got a lot of coins out there which can be mined with just
        a CPU, such as <a href="https://duinocoin.com/">Duino coin</a>.

        <li>
          Let’s get started, visit
          <a href="https://wallet.duinocoin.com/">Duino web crypto wallet</a>
          and create one for yourself.
        </li>
        <li>
          Download the miner program from GitHub releases page (Windows or
          Linux)
          <a href="https://github.com/revoxhere/duino-coin/releases/latest"
            >here</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          Install Python 3.x from
          <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a> in your Computer
          if you don’t have python installed
        </li>
        <li>Extract the zip and navigate to the folder.</li>
        <li>
          Now start the mining by starting the <em>PC_Miner.py</em> python
          program with <code>$ python3 PC_Miner.py</code> command from Terminal
          (for Linux) or CMD (for Windows).
        </li>
        <li>
          After starting you will be prompted to enter your wallet address which
          we previously created using Dunino web wallet.
